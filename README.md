# Image-to-Minecraft
This is an old project of mine that I found while cleaning up my pc, if there is something broken feel free to fix it or send me a message.

## How to use:
- Install all needed packages from requirements.txt.
- Install the RaspberryJuice plugin on a Minecraft server. (There is a similar mod available for singleplayer)
- In processing.py modify the main section to grab the part of the screen you want to capture. You can also change the scale and ratios if you want.
- Run processing.py

I also made it so that you can use the video from an ESP32 Cam. To use it modify the get_packets.py file to set the ip of your camera. Run this instead of processing.py
